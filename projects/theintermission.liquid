    <h1>TL;DR</h1>
    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>The Intermission was the York/Sheridan Program in Design's graduating class showcase for 2016. Our goal was to create a showcase of student work embodies the graduating class. I lead the team that worked on the web presence. We built a static site generator, admin panel for collecting work, gallery and dynamic portfolio pages for each student.</p>
