# metalsmith-permalinks

  A Metalsmith plugin that applies a custom permalink pattern to files, and renames them so that they're nested properly for static sites (converting `about.html` into `about/index.html`).

## Installation

    $ npm install metalsmith-permalinks

## Usage

```js
var Metalsmith = require('metalsmith');
var permalinks = require('metalsmith-permalinks');

var metalsmith = new Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(permalinks({
    pattern: ':title'
  }));
```

  The `pattern` can contain a reference to any piece of metadata associated with the file by using the `:PROPERTY` syntax for placeholders.

  If no pattern is provided, the files won't be remapped, but the `path` metadata key will still be set, so that you can use it for outputting links to files in the template.

## CLI Usage

  You can also use the plugin with the Metalsmith CLI by adding a key to your `metalsmith.json` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "metalsmith-permalinks": {
      "pattern": ":title"
    }
  }
}
```
