## Development

Run `yarn start` to start up the development server.

Run `yarn storybook` to start up the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server.

## Deploying

Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

> Due to weirdness with GitHub Pages, user sites (like this one) are required to use `master` as the source for GitHub Pages. As a result we use `src` as our main working branch and deploy to `master`.
